# Department Selection & Lecturer Loading Fix

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Issue**: Department selection not properly loading lecturers for the selected department

---

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

**Issue**: When clicking on a department card, the system wasn't loading the lecturers specific to that department  
**Symptom**: Lecturer dropdown would remain empty or show wrong lecturers  
**Root Cause**: Department card selection only set form values but didn't trigger lecturer loading

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Before Fix**:
```javascript
// Department card click handler
$('#departmentSelect').val(deptId);
$('#lecturerSelect').val(hodId);  // ❌ Just set value without loading lecturers

// No lecturer loading triggered
// No validation of HOD matching
```

### **The Problem**:
1. **No Lecturer Loading**: Clicking department card didn't load department-specific lecturers
2. **Wrong HOD Matching**: Used `hod_id` (user ID) instead of finding corresponding lecturer
3. **Empty Dropdowns**: Lecturer select would be empty or show wrong data
4. **No Error Handling**: Failed silently when lecturers couldn't be loaded

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **File: `js/assign-hod.js` - `setupDepartmentCardInteractions()`**

**After Fix**:
```javascript
$('#departmentSelect').val(deptId);

// Load lecturers for the selected department
console.log('Loading lecturers for selected department:', deptId);
loadLecturersForDepartment(deptId).then(() => {
    // After lecturers are loaded, set the current HOD if valid
    if (hodId && hodName && !isInvalid) {
        // Find the lecturer that corresponds to this HOD
        const matchingLecturer = AppState.lecturers.find(lecturer => 
            lecturer.full_name === hodName || 
            `${lecturer.first_name} ${lecturer.last_name}` === hodName
        );
        
        if (matchingLecturer) {
            $('#lecturerSelect').val(matchingLecturer.id);
            $('#currentAssignmentInfo').show();
            $('#currentHodName').text(hodName);
        } else {
            $('#lecturerSelect').val('');
            $('#currentAssignmentInfo').hide();
            console.warn('Could not find matching lecturer for HOD:', hodName);
        }
    } else {
        $('#lecturerSelect').val('');
        // Handle invalid or no HOD cases
    }
    
    Validation.validateForm();
}).catch(error => {
    console.error('Failed to load lecturers for department:', error);
    $('#lecturerSelect').val('');
    $('#currentAssignmentInfo').hide();
    UI.showAlert('warning', 'Failed to load lecturers for selected department');
});
```
