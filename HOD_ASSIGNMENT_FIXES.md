# HOD Assignment System - Issues Fixed

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Issues Addressed**: Department-specific lecturer filtering and network errors

---

## 🐛 Issues Identified & Fixed

### **Issue 1: Department-specific Lecturer Filtering Not Working**
**Problem**: When selecting a department, the lecturer dropdown was showing all lecturers instead of filtering by the selected department.

**Root Cause**: The JavaScript was calling a generic `loadLecturers()` function that didn't properly handle department-specific filtering.

**✅ Solution Applied**:
1. **Updated JavaScript Event Handler** (`js/assign-hod.js` lines 571-593):
   - Modified the department selection change handler to call `loadLecturersForDepartment(selectedDeptId)`
   - Added proper logging to track the filtering process

2. **Added New Function** (`js/assign-hod.js` lines 1299-1334):
   - Created `loadLecturersForDepartment(departmentId)` function
   - Makes direct AJAX call to API with department_id parameter
   - Properly updates the lecturer dropdown with filtered results

### **Issue 2: Network Error on Form Submission**
**Problem**: Clicking "Assign HOD" button returned "Network error occurred" instead of processing the assignment.

**Root Cause**: The API backend was trying to use a non-existent `InputValidator` class with complex validation methods.

**✅ Solution Applied**:
1. **Simplified API Validation** (`api/assign-hod-api.php` lines 488-519):
   - Replaced complex `InputValidator` class usage with simple PHP `filter_var()` validation
   - Added proper error handling for invalid inputs
   - Fixed the hod_id validation logic to avoid double conversion

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
   - Improved error messages for better user feedback
   - Fixed validation flow to prevent false positives

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### **File: `js/assign-hod.js`**
```javascript
// Added new function for department-specific lecturer loading
function loadLecturersForDepartment(departmentId) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const url = `${CONFIG.apiBaseUrl}?action=get_lecturers&ajax=1&department_id=${departmentId}`;
        
        $.ajax({
            url: url,
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
                'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
                'X-CSRF-Token': window.csrfToken
            },
            timeout: 30000,
            success: function(response) {
                if (response.status === 'success') {
                    AppState.setLecturers(response.data);
                    resolve(response.data);
                } else {
                    reject(new Error(response.message || 'Failed to load lecturers'));
                }
            },
            error: function(xhr, status, error) {
                // Enhanced error handling
                reject(new Error(errorMessage));
            }
        });
    });
}
```

### **File: `api/assign-hod-api.php`**
```php
// Simplified input validation (lines 488-519)
function handleAssignHod() {
    global $pdo, $logger, $redisCache;

    // Simple input validation
    if (!isset($_POST['department_id']) || empty($_POST['department_id'])) {
        echo json_encode([
            'status' => 'error',
            'message' => 'Department ID is required'
        ]);
        return;
    }

    $department_id = filter_var($_POST['department_id'], FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
    if ($department_id === false || $department_id <= 0) {
        echo json_encode([
            'status' => 'error',
            'message' => 'Invalid department ID'
        ]);
        return;
    }

    // Fixed hod_id validation logic
    $hod_id_raw = $_POST['hod_id'] ?? null;
    $hod_id = null;
    if (!empty($hod_id_raw) && $hod_id_raw !== 'null' && $hod_id_raw !== '') {
        $hod_id = filter_var($hod_id_raw, FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
        if ($hod_id === false || $hod_id <= 0) {
            echo json_encode([
                'status' => 'error',
                'message' => 'Invalid HOD ID'
            ]);
            return;
        }
    }
    
    // ... rest of the function continues with proper validation
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### **Test 1: Department Selection**
- ✅ Select a department from the dropdown
- ✅ Verify that lecturer dropdown updates with only lecturers from that department
- ✅ Confirm that "All Lecturers" is shown when no department is selected

### **Test 2: HOD Assignment**
- ✅ Select a department and lecturer
- ✅ Click "Assign HOD" button
- ✅ Verify successful assignment with proper success message
- ✅ Confirm database is updated correctly

### **Test 3: Error Handling**
- ✅ Test with invalid department ID
- ✅ Test with invalid lecturer ID
- ✅ Verify proper error messages are displayed

## 🚀 How to Test the Fixes

1. **Open the HOD Assignment Page**:
   ```
   http://localhost/final_project_1/assign-hod.php
   ```

2. **Test Department Filtering**:
   - Select a department from the "Department" dropdown
   - Watch the "Head of Department" dropdown update with only lecturers from that department
   - Try selecting different departments to see the filtering in action

3. **Test HOD Assignment**:
   - Select a department
   - Choose a lecturer from the filtered list
   - Click "Assign HOD"
   - Verify you get a success message instead of a network error

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Try assigning the same HOD to multiple departments
   - Test removing HOD assignment (leave lecturer field empty)
   - Test with departments that have no lecturers
